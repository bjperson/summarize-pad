# Summarize-pad

If you have an heavy use of EtherPad then you may be interested.

This tool is designed to live parse any EtherPad content to summarize it with simple rules.

The resulting summary can be clicked to navigate between the different tasks.

You can also tag your tasks with different colors.

`Or`

Edit any bookmark already created by copy/paste the raw code of [this page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjperson/summarize-pad/gh-pages/bookmarklet.js) into the location field.
